# Emacs config

My emacs config. And I don't think it's useful for anyone but me.

## Version

Current Emacs version: 24.3

## Modules

Since I started to use ELPA instead of manual package installation I found it difficult to track all the packages I use.

You can see most of my packages in package_list.

## Colors

All colors are configured for [Misterioso](https://github.com/tovbinm/emacs-24-mac/blob/master/etc/themes/misterioso-theme.el) theme and "white on black" terminals.

## TODO

Describe useful bindings && workflow.

## Sources

I took a lot of .emacs code from [emacs-fu](http://emacs-fu.blogspot.ru/).

Another one source is, of course, [Emacs Wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/).
