* Emacs config
My emacs config. And I don't think it's useful for anyone but me.

** Version

Current Emacs version: 24.4

** Installation

*No more Cask!*
Just clone this repo to ~/ and run from emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
package-install-selected-packages
#+END_SRC

** Colors

All colors are configured for
[[https://github.com/tovbinm/emacs-24-mac/blob/master/etc/themes/misterioso-theme.el][Misterioso]]
theme and "white on black" terminals.

*UPD* Changed theme to /deeper-blue/. Everything looks fine.

** Xdg (Gnome/KDE/etc) menu

To add Emacs Client to Xdg menu copy .local from repo to your =HOME=
directory

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ cp -r path_to_repo/emacs_client/.local/ ~/
#+END_SRC

and add executable permissions for all users for .desktop file:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ chmod a+x .local/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop
#+END_SRC
