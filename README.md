# Emacs config
My emacs config. And I don't think it's useful for anyone but me.

## Version
Current Emacs version: 24.3

## Packages
In order to autoinstall all packages you need to install [Cask](http://cask.github.io/).  
After [Cask](http://cask.github.io/) installation go to **.emacs.d** directory & execute

    $ cask

## Colors
All colors are configured for [Misterioso](https://github.com/tovbinm/emacs-24-mac/blob/master/etc/themes/misterioso-theme.el) theme and "white on black" terminals.

**UPD**  
Changed theme to *deeper-blue*. Everything looks fine.

## TODO
Describe useful bindings && workflow.  
Add autoinstallation script.

## Sources
I took a lot of .emacs code from [emacs-fu](http://emacs-fu.blogspot.ru/).  
Another one source is, of course, [Emacs Wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/).
